The goal of this project is to fix the server code.

Fixing it by modernizing it to C++11, optimizing, removing bad practices.
And seriously... there is LOTS of awful code here!

The newest versions of TFS and OpenTibia have improved a lot, 
but it's not supporting the protocols, 7.4, 7.6, 7.7. 
Is possible implement the support for them, 
but then we'll have tons of code of features that we don't need.
Fixing code is the first step.
Until the first step is completed there will be only bug fixes, 
no feature implementations.

Focus on protocol 7.4 first.
